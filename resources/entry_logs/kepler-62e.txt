1. Using transit detection method (*), super-Earth Kepler-62e with the size larger than Earth but smaller than gas giants was found by NASA's Kepler Space Telescope in 2013.

2. It orbits within the habitable zone of its K2V-type star Kepler-62 (**), which is approximately 1200 light-years from Earth in the constellation Lyra.

3. The planet completes its orbit around its star in 122 Earth's days at a distance of 0.427 AU.

4. It is speculated that due to its size, Kepler-62e could be an ocean world with global oceans much deeper than on Earth. Being large in size suggests a significant gravitational pull that could retain a thick atmosphere and interesting marine life forms.

5. Because Kepler-62e locates too far away from us, there has been no direct observation about its exact composition of the planet yet, whether to be rocky or gaseous.

(*) Transit method observes periodic dips in a star's brightness when a planet crosses in front of it from our perspective. This gives information about the planet's size and orbit.

(**) cooler and smaller than our Sun which is a M-type star.
