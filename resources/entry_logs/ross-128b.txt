1. Earth-sized ROSS-128 b (*) was discovered through the radial velocity method (**) by ESO's High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) instrument in November 2017.

2. It orbits in the inner edge of the habitable zone of the red dwarf ROSS 128 (cooler than our Sun!), which is approximately 11 light-years away from Earth in the constellation of Virgo.

3. The planet completes its orbit around its star in just 9.9 Earth's days at a distance of just 0.0496 AU.

4. Unlike many red dwarfs known for violent solar flares that could strip the planet's atmosphere, the star ROSS 128 is relatively quiet, increasing the possibility of ROSS-128b maintaining a stable atmosphere conducive to potential life.

5. Ross 128 is moving towards our solar system and is expected to become our nearest stellar neighbour in 79 000 years.

6. Because of the close proximity to its star, ROSS-128 b is thought to be tidally locked (**)

(*) Due to its mass and radius, ROSS-128 b is suggested to have rocky composition.

(**) radial velocity observes the spectrum of light from a star and looks for shifts caused by the gravitational influence of an orbiting planet. The gravitational pull between the two bodies causes the star to move in a small orbit around their common center of mass, which alters the star's velocity towards (light shifts to shorter wavelengths) or away (light shifts to longer wavelengths) from Earth.

(***) tidal lock is when the planet always has one of its side facing its host star, while the other remains in darkness, resulting in extreme temperature differences and creating a "twilight zone" where conditions could be just right for life.
